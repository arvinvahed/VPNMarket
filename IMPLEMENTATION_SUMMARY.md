## Technical Highlights

### 1. Pricing Resolution Algorithm

```php
Priority Order:
1. Reseller-specific override (percent)
2. Reseller-specific override (fixed price)
3. Plan-level discount percent
4. Plan-level fixed reseller price
5. Plan hidden if none set
```

### 2. Username Convention

```
Plan-based: {prefix}_{resellerId}_order_{orderId}_{index}
Traffic-based: {prefix}_{resellerId}_cfg_{configId}

Example: resell_1_order_42_1
```

### 3. Panel Integration

The ResellerProvisioner service abstracts panel APIs:
- Marzban
- Marzneshin (with service whitelist support)
- X-UI

All panel operations (create, update, delete, disable, enable) are handled uniformly.

### 4. Usage Sync Strategy

- Runs every N minutes (configurable)
- Fetches usage from all panels
- Updates per-config usage
- Aggregates total reseller usage
- Applies auto-disable rules
- Logs all events

### 5. Auto-Disable Rules

```
Config disabled if:
- config.usage_bytes >= config.traffic_limit_bytes
- now >= config.expires_at
- reseller.traffic_used_bytes >= reseller.traffic_total_bytes
- now > reseller.window_ends_at
- reseller.status === 'suspended'
```

## Configuration

### Settings Table Keys

```php
'reseller.username_prefix' => 'resell'
'reseller.bulk_max_quantity' => '50'
'reseller.configs_max_active' => '50'
'reseller.usage_sync_interval_minutes' => '5'
```

### Routes

```php
/reseller - Dashboard
/reseller/plans - Browse plans (plan-based)
/reseller/bulk - Create bulk order (plan-based)
/reseller/orders/{id} - Order details (plan-based)
/reseller/configs - List configs (traffic-based)
/reseller/configs/create - Create config (traffic-based)
/reseller/configs/{id}/disable - Disable config
/reseller/configs/{id}/enable - Enable config
/reseller/configs/{id} - Delete config
/reseller/sync - Manual sync
```

## Testing

### Run Tests

```bash
# All tests
php artisan test

# Reseller tests only
php artisan test --filter=reseller

# Unit tests
php artisan test tests/Unit/ResellerPricingServiceTest.php

# Feature tests
php artisan test tests/Feature/ResellerDashboardTest.php
```

### Test Coverage

- Pricing resolution: 5 test cases
- Access control: 4 test cases
- Total assertions: 9+

## Performance Considerations

1. **Eager Loading**: All relationships are eager loaded in list views
2. **Pagination**: Config list uses pagination (20 per page)
3. **Queue Jobs**: Heavy operations run async
4. **Caching**: Consider caching available plans
5. **Indexes**: Database indexes on frequently queried columns

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Reseller API for external integrations
- [ ] Analytics dashboard for resellers
- [ ] Multi-currency support
- [ ] Webhook notifications
- [ ] White-label branding options
- [ ] Reseller referral system
- [ ] Automated reports via email

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

1. Run migrations: `php artisan migrate`
2. Seed settings: `php artisan db:seed --class=ResellerSettingsSeeder`
3. Clear cache: `php artisan optimize:clear`
4. Configure queue worker: `php artisan queue:work`
5. Set up scheduler: Add `* * * * * cd /path && php artisan schedule:run` to cron
6. Test reseller conversion: Convert a test user via admin panel
7. Test plan-based flow: Create and fulfill a bulk order
8. Test traffic-based flow: Create and manage a config
9. Verify sync job: Check logs after sync interval
