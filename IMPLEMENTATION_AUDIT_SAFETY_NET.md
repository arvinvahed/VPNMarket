# Implementation Summary: Audit Safety Net for ResellerConfig Status Changes

## Overview
This implementation adds a comprehensive audit trail system to ensure that all `reseller_configs.status` changes are recorded in the database, addressing the issue of "silent" status transitions.

## Changes Made

### 1. ResellerConfigObserver (NEW)
**File**: `app/Observers/ResellerConfigObserver.php`

- **Purpose**: Provides an audit safety net that automatically creates a `ResellerConfigEvent` when status changes occur without an explicit event
- **Key Features**:
  - Monitors `updated` events on `ResellerConfig` model
  - Only creates audit events if no recent domain event exists (within 2 seconds)
  - Captures rich metadata: `from_status`, `to_status`, `actor`, `route`, `ip`, `panel_id`, `panel_type`
  - Logs at `notice` level for visibility (with credentials sanitized)
  - Non-invasive: doesn't interfere with existing event recording logic

### 2. AppServiceProvider
**File**: `app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php`

- Registered `ResellerConfigObserver` in the `boot()` method
- Observer is now active for all `ResellerConfig` model updates

### 3. SyncResellerUsageJob
**File**: `Modules/Reseller/Jobs/SyncResellerUsageJob.php`

**Changes**:
- Upgraded log level from `info` to `notice` for key operations (start, complete, config disable)
- Added `panel_id` to disable log messages for better traceability
- Added defensive null checks in `fetchMarzbanUsage()` and `fetchMarzneshinUsage()`
- Defensive casts already existed in `fetchXUIUsage()` (verified)

### 4. Documentation
**File**: `docs/RESELLER_FEATURE.md`

- Added new `audit_status_changed` event type to event types table
- Documented the observer's behavior and metadata structure
- Added query examples for audit events
- Clarified that audit events are for auditability only, not enforcement

### 5. Tests (NEW)
**File**: `tests/Feature/ResellerAuditObserverTest.php`

**Test Coverage**:
1. ✅ Direct status update creates audit event
2. ✅ Observer doesn't duplicate when manual_disabled exists
3. ✅ Observer doesn't duplicate when auto_disabled exists
4. ✅ Observer captures authenticated user as actor
5. ✅ Observer ignores non-status updates
6. ✅ Observer creates audit event after grace period
7. ✅ Multiple status changes create multiple audit events

**Updated Test Files** (to mock `Log::notice()`):
- `tests/Feature/ResellerConfigExpiryEnforcementTest.php`
- `tests/Feature/ResellerConfigTrafficLimitValidationTest.php`
- `tests/Feature/ResellerGraceThresholdsTest.php`
- `tests/Feature/ResellerRetryLogicTest.php`
- `tests/Feature/ResellerUsageSyncTest.php`

## How It Works

### Normal Flow (No Audit Event)
```
Controller/Job creates event → Update status → Observer sees recent event → Skip audit event
```

### Safety Net Flow (Audit Event Created)
```
Direct status update → Observer sees no recent event → Create audit_status_changed event + log
```

### Event Deduplication Logic
The observer checks for recent events (within 2 seconds) of types:
- `auto_disabled`
- `manual_disabled`
- `auto_enabled`
- `manual_enabled`
- `expired`

If any of these exist, it skips creating an `audit_status_changed` event.

## Example Metadata

### Audit Event Metadata
```json
{
  "from_status": "active",
  "to_status": "disabled",
  "actor": 123,
  "route": "admin.reseller.configs.update",
  "ip": "192.168.1.1",
  "panel_id": 5,
  "panel_type": "marzneshin"
}
```

### Log Entry (Sanitized)
```
[notice] ResellerConfig status changed (audit event created)
{
  "config_id": 42,
  "from_status": "active",
  "to_status": "disabled",
  "actor": 123,
  "panel_id": 5,
  "route": "admin.reseller.configs.update"
}
```

## Test Results

All tests pass successfully:
- ✅ 7 new observer tests (25 assertions)
- ✅ All existing reseller tests pass
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Acceptance Criteria Met

✅ **Any status change creates a ResellerConfigEvent record**
- Observer ensures audit events are created as fallback

✅ **No duplicate audit events when proper domain event exists**
- 2-second grace window prevents duplicates

✅ **Logs written at notice level**
- Both observer and job use `notice` level
- Credentials sanitized (IP removed from logs)

✅ **All existing tests pass**
- Updated to mock `Log::notice()`

✅ **New tests validate observer behavior**
- Comprehensive test coverage for all scenarios

## Benefits

1. **Guaranteed Audit Trail**: Every status change is now recorded in DB
2. **Non-Invasive**: Doesn't change existing code paths
3. **No Performance Impact**: Observer only fires on status changes
4. **Better Debugging**: Rich metadata helps diagnose issues
5. **Compliance**: Full auditability for operations teams

## Usage for Operators

### Query Audit Events
```php
// Find all silent status changes (audit events only)
$auditEvents = ResellerConfigEvent::where('type', 'audit_status_changed')->get();

// Check if a specific config had silent changes
$silentChanges = ResellerConfigEvent::where('reseller_config_id', $configId)
    ->where('type', 'audit_status_changed')
    ->get();

// Find who changed a config status
$event = ResellerConfigEvent::where('reseller_config_id', $configId)
    ->latest()
    ->first();
echo "Changed by: " . ($event->meta['actor'] === 'system' ? 'System' : "User {$event->meta['actor']}");
```

## Future Enhancements

- Consider adding webhook notifications for audit events
- Implement a dashboard widget showing recent audit events
- Add filtering in admin panel for configs with audit events only
