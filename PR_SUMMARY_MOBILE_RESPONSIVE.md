# Pull Request Summary: Mobile-Friendly Reseller Panel

## Overview
This PR implements comprehensive mobile-responsive design for the VPNMarket Reseller panel, ensuring all reseller-facing pages are fully functional and user-friendly on small screens (≤640px).

## Problem Statement
The Reseller panel was not optimized for mobile devices, resulting in:
- Horizontal overflow on small screens
- Small touch targets making actions difficult
- Cluttered tables with too many columns
- Buttons and forms that were hard to use on mobile
- Inconsistent spacing and typography

## Solution
Implemented a comprehensive mobile-first responsive design using Tailwind CSS utilities, following industry best practices for mobile UX.
