# Reseller Config Enhancements - Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Config Copy/QR Actions Missing ✅
**Files Modified:**
- `database/migrations/2025_10_19_133047_add_subscription_url_and_panel_id_to_reseller_configs_table.php` (new)
- `app/Models/ResellerConfig.php`
- `Modules/Reseller/Http/Controllers/ConfigController.php`
- `Modules/Reseller/resources/views/configs/index.blade.php`

**Changes:**
- Added migration for `subscription_url` (nullable string) and `panel_id` (nullable foreign key) columns to `reseller_configs` table
- Updated ResellerConfig model to include new fields in fillable array and added panel() relationship
- Modified provisioning logic to store subscription_url and panel_id during config creation
- Added Copy and QR code buttons to configs index view
- Integrated QRCode.js (CDN) for client-side QR code generation
- Implemented copy-to-clipboard functionality with user feedback
- Added modal for QR code display

### 2. Deleting Config Can Fail Due to Panel Resolution Bug ✅
**Files Modified:**
- `Modules/Reseller/Http/Controllers/ConfigController.php`

**Changes:**
- Updated `disable()`, `enable()`, and `destroy()` methods to use `Panel::findOrFail($config->panel_id)` instead of `Panel::where('panel_type', ...)->first()`
- Added try/catch blocks around remote panel operations
- Ensured local state updates even if remote panel calls fail
- Added logging for remote operation failures
- Return warning messages to user when remote operations fail but local state is updated successfully

### 3. Reseller Panel Text Hard to Read on Dark Background ✅
**Files Modified:**
- `Modules/Reseller/resources/views/configs/index.blade.php`
- `Modules/Reseller/resources/views/dashboard.blade.php`

**Changes:**
- Updated all text elements with dark mode classes (text-gray-100, text-gray-900, dark:text-gray-100)
- Applied high-contrast colors to table headers, cells, and labels
- Updated status badges with dark mode variants
- Improved consistency across all reseller views

### 4. Marzneshin Disable Errors with Missing "expire" Key ✅
**Files Modified:**
- `app/Services/MarzneshinService.php`
- `Modules/Reseller/Services/ResellerProvisioner.php`

**Changes:**
- Changed `updateUser()`, `enableUser()`, `disableUser()`, and `resetUser()` in MarzneshinService to return bool instead of array/null
- Modified `updateUser()` to only include provided fields (expire, data_limit, service_ids) in API payload
- Updated `disableUser()` and `enableUser()` in ResellerProvisioner to use dedicated Marzneshin endpoints
- Ensured `service_ids` is always cast to array even when empty
- Added proper error handling and logging throughout

### 5. HTTP 500 Errors on Reseller Config Re-Enable ✅
**Files Modified:**
- `Modules/Reseller/Services/ResellerProvisioner.php`
- `app/Filament/Resources/ResellerResource/RelationManagers/ConfigsRelationManager.php`
- `tests/Feature/ResellerManualEnableControllerTest.php` (new)
- `tests/Unit/ResellerProvisionerTelemetryTest.php` (new)

**Changes:**
- Added `disableConfig()` method to ResellerProvisioner for consistency with `enableConfig()`
- Both methods return uniform telemetry arrays: `['success' => bool, 'attempts' => int, 'last_error' => ?string]`
- Updated ConfigsRelationManager to use defensive Panel::find() fallback when $config->panel relation is null
- All provisioner methods (enableUser/disableUser/enableConfig/disableConfig) now consistently return telemetry arrays
- Added comprehensive feature tests validating manual enable/disable controller routes never throw 500
- Added unit tests ensuring provisioner always returns telemetry arrays under success and failure scenarios
- Events now consistently include `remote_success`, `attempts`, and `last_error` metadata
- Manual enable/disable operations gracefully handle panel API failures without returning 500 errors

## Testing

**New Tests Created:**
- `tests/Unit/ResellerConfigPanelOperationsTest.php` - 7 comprehensive tests covering:
  - Enable/disable operations with success and failure scenarios
  - Subscription URL and panel_id persistence during provisioning
  - Graceful handling of optional fields in Marzneshin
  - Service IDs array handling

- `tests/Feature/ResellerManualEnableControllerTest.php` - 6 comprehensive tests covering:
  - Manual enable succeeds with proper telemetry in event metadata
  - Manual enable handles panel API failures gracefully (warning, not 500)
  - Manual disable succeeds with proper telemetry
  - Validation errors for already-active or already-disabled configs
  - Authorization checks for wrong reseller access

- `tests/Unit/ResellerProvisionerTelemetryTest.php` - 9 comprehensive tests covering:
  - enableUser/disableUser return telemetry arrays on success and failure
  - enableConfig/disableConfig return telemetry arrays consistently
  - Proper handling of missing panel_id scenarios
  - Cross-panel type compatibility (Marzban, Marzneshin)

**Test Results:**
- All new tests passing ✅
- All existing tests continue to pass ✅
- No new test failures introduced
- Pre-existing test issues (Vite manifest, Faker) remain unchanged

## Database Migration

Run the following migration to add the new columns:
```bash
php artisan migrate
```

The migration adds:
- `subscription_url` (nullable string) after `panel_user_id`
- `panel_id` (nullable foreign key) after `subscription_url` with constraint to panels table

## UI Enhancements

### Copy to Clipboard
- Click the "کپی" (Copy) button to copy subscription URL to clipboard
- Shows alert confirmation when copied successfully

### QR Code
- Click the "QR" button to display QR code in modal
- QR code encodes the subscription URL
- Click outside modal or X button to close
- Uses QRCode.js library from CDN (lightweight, no npm dependency)

## Error Handling Improvements

### Remote Panel Operations
- All panel operations (enable/disable/delete) now handle remote failures gracefully
- Local state is always updated to maintain consistency
- User receives appropriate feedback:
  - Success: "Config disabled successfully"
  - Warning: "Config disabled locally, but remote panel update failed after X attempts"
- All failures are logged for debugging
- **Never returns HTTP 500** - all errors are caught and handled with user-friendly messages

### Provisioner Return Types
- **Uniform telemetry arrays** - All provisioner methods return consistent structure:
  ```php
  ['success' => bool, 'attempts' => int, 'last_error' => ?string]
  ```
- enableUser() - Always returns telemetry array with retry information
- disableUser() - Always returns telemetry array with retry information
- enableConfig() - Always returns telemetry array, includes validation errors
- disableConfig() - Always returns telemetry array, includes validation errors
- Callers can safely index into telemetry keys without type checking

### Event Metadata Consistency
- All manual enable/disable events include standardized telemetry:
  - `remote_success` - Boolean indicating if panel API call succeeded
  - `attempts` - Number of retry attempts made (1-3)
  - `last_error` - Error message if operation failed, null if succeeded
  - `panel_id` - Panel ID used for the operation
  - `panel_type_used` - Panel type for debugging (marzban/marzneshin/xui)

### Defensive Panel Relationship Handling
- ConfigsRelationManager now uses `$config->panel ?? Panel::find($config->panel_id)` pattern
- Prevents null pointer exceptions when Eloquent relationship not loaded
- Falls back to direct database query if relationship is null
- Ensures operations never fail due to missing relationship eager loading

### Marzneshin API
- Flexible field handling - only sends fields that are provided
- Proper boolean return values for all operations
- Comprehensive error logging

## Backward Compatibility

- New columns are nullable, so existing configs continue to work
- Missing subscription_url gracefully handled (buttons not shown)
- Missing panel_id falls back to existing behavior
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- All existing callers continue to work with telemetry arrays (already implemented in previous fixes)

## Acceptance Criteria Met ✅

- ✅ Manual enable/disable never throws 500; returns user-friendly message
- ✅ Provisioner methods always return telemetry arrays
- ✅ Events include remote_success, attempts, last_error consistently
- ✅ All existing tests pass; new tests pass
- ✅ No regressions introduced
