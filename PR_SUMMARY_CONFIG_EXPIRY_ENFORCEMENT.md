# PR Summary: Traffic-Based Reseller Config Expiry Enforcement

## Problem Statement
Traffic-based resellers were unable to create configs with expiry dates beyond their reseller window due to a blocking validation. The requirement was to:
1. Remove this validation and allow creating configs beyond the reseller window
2. Implement global enforcement through automatic suspension when resellers run out of time or traffic
3. Auto-disable configs (rate-limited at 3/sec) when reseller is suspended
4. Block suspended resellers from accessing the reseller panel
5. Auto-reactivate resellers and re-enable only system-disabled configs when admins recharge/extend

## Solution Overview

### Changes Made

#### 1. ConfigController - Remove Blocking Validation ✅
**File**: `Modules/Reseller/Http/Controllers/ConfigController.php`

**Change**: Removed lines 105-108 that validated config expiry against reseller window:
```php
// REMOVED:
if ($reseller->window_ends_at && $expiresAt->gt($reseller->window_ends_at)) {
    return back()->with('error', 'Config expiry cannot exceed your reseller window end date.');
}
```

**Result**: Resellers can now create configs with any expiry date, regardless of their window end date. Traffic limit validation remains in place.

#### 2. SyncResellerUsageJob - Auto-Suspend Implementation ✅
**File**: `Modules/Reseller/Jobs/SyncResellerUsageJob.php`

**Changes**:
- Added reseller suspension when quota exhausted or window expired (lines 86-92)
- Existing rate-limiting logic already in place (3 configs per second)
- Records `ResellerConfigEvent` with type `auto_disabled` and proper reasons

**Key Code**:
```php
// Check reseller-level limits
if (!$reseller->hasTrafficRemaining() || !$reseller->isWindowValid()) {
    // Suspend the reseller if not already suspended
    if ($reseller->status !== 'suspended') {
        $reseller->update(['status' => 'suspended']);
        Log::info("Reseller {$reseller->id} suspended due to quota/window exhaustion");
    }
    $this->disableResellerConfigs($reseller);
}
```

**Result**: When resellers run out of traffic or time, they are automatically suspended and their configs are disabled with proper event logging.

---

#### 3. ReenableResellerConfigsJob - Auto-Recovery Implementation ✅
**File**: `Modules/Reseller/Jobs/ReenableResellerConfigsJob.php`

**Changes**:
- Modified to look for suspended resellers instead of active ones (line 31)
- Added reseller reactivation when recovered (lines 46-48)
- Existing logic already handles selective re-enable and rate-limiting

**Key Code**:
```php
// Get suspended traffic-based resellers that now have quota and valid window
$resellers = Reseller::where('status', 'suspended')
    ->where('type', 'traffic')
    ->get()
    ->filter(function ($reseller) {
        return $reseller->hasTrafficRemaining() && $reseller->isWindowValid();
    });

// ... for each eligible reseller:
$reseller->update(['status' => 'active']);
Log::info("Reseller {$reseller->id} reactivated after recovery");
```

**Result**: When admins recharge traffic or extend windows, resellers are automatically reactivated and only system-disabled configs are re-enabled (manually disabled configs remain disabled).

---

#### 4. Middleware - Access Blocking (Already Implemented) ✅
**File**: `app/Http/Middleware/EnsureUserIsReseller.php`

**Status**: No changes needed - middleware already blocks suspended resellers

**Existing Code**:
```php
if ($reseller->isSuspended()) {
    abort(403, 'Your reseller account has been suspended. Please contact support.');
}
```

**Result**: Suspended resellers receive a 403 error when attempting to access any reseller panel page.

### Testing

#### New Test File
**File**: `tests/Feature/ResellerConfigExpiryEnforcementTest.php`

8 comprehensive tests covering:
1. ✅ Config creation beyond reseller window
2. ✅ Reseller suspension when quota exhausted
3. ✅ Reseller suspension when window expired
4. ✅ Suspended reseller panel access blocking
5. ✅ Reseller reactivation after quota increase
6. ✅ Reseller reactivation after window extension
7. ✅ Manually disabled configs not re-enabled
8. ✅ Rate limiting enforcement during auto-disable

#### Updated Existing Tests
**File**: `tests/Feature/ResellerUsageSyncTest.php`

Updated 2 tests to expect suspended status:
- `test_reenable_job_restores_configs_after_quota_increase`
- `test_reenable_job_does_not_restore_manually_disabled_configs`

#### Test Results
```
✅ All 14 tests passing (65 assertions)
✅ Duration: 6.03s
✅ No security vulnerabilities detected (CodeQL)
```

### Documentation

#### QA Guide
**File**: `QA_RESELLER_CONFIG_EXPIRY_ENFORCEMENT.md`

Comprehensive QA guide including:
- 9 detailed test scenarios with step-by-step instructions
- Edge cases documentation
- Expected vs actual results
- Database schema notes
- Monitoring and logging guidelines
- Rollback plan
- Known limitations

---

## Impact Analysis

### Breaking Changes
**None** - This is an enhancement that removes a restriction. Existing functionality remains intact.

### Database Changes
**None** - All required columns already exist in the database schema.

### Behavioral Changes
1. **Resellers**: Can now create configs with longer expiry dates
2. **System**: Automatically manages reseller lifecycle based on quota/time
3. **Admins**: Less manual intervention needed for suspend/unsuspend workflows

### Performance Considerations
- Rate limiting ensures config disable/enable operations don't overwhelm the system
- Jobs run on schedule: SyncResellerUsageJob (1-5 min), ReenableResellerConfigsJob (1 min)
- For resellers with many configs, disable/enable may take several seconds

3. Test config creation with extended expiry
4. Test admin recharge/extend actions

### Monitoring
Watch for these log messages:
- `"Reseller {id} suspended due to quota/window exhaustion"`
- `"Reseller {id} reactivated after recovery"`
- `"Starting auto-disable for reseller {id}"`
- `"Auto-enable completed for reseller {id}"`

```bash
git revert 8d5554a
git revert 58a7a2d
```
